Opened in 1876, Saltwell Park soon became known as ‘The People's Park’. It is
Grade ll listed and on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens for its
special historic interest. Within its 55 acres it has 12 Grade ll listed
structures including ornate entrance gates, the Salte Welle and Saltwell Towers,
the mansion house and former residence of William Wailes (1808-1881) the
renowned stained glass manufacturer.

The Friends of Saltwell Park was established in 2005 and with over 200 members
it is considered as a major stakeholder in regards to the future well-being and
development of the Park. To that end and following a widespread consultation in
June 2016 we have put ‘Community, Environment and Heritage’ at the core of our
development strategy.

As part of our Heritage Programme and under guidance from the Tyne and Wear
Heritage Forum through HeritageACT! we are planning to become involved in
Historic England’s ‘Enrich the List’ programme. This encourages contributions
from the public and community groups to help keep information and records on
England’s historic buildings and places of interest relevant and up to date.

As a continuation of our June consultation, the Friends are developing our
community and volunteer network. We see this as a valuable resource to help
deliver the Heritage element of our strategy, and to hopefully begin the process
of protecting Saltwell Park’s unique 12 listed structures for years to come.
