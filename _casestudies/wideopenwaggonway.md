There was a special event held in November 2016 to celebrate the completion of
phase one of the Wideopen Waggonway HeritageACT! project at the entrance to the
waggonway path beside Bellway's new 5 Mile Housing Development near the southern
end of Wideopen on the Great North Road.

The Wideopen Waggonway HeritageACT! project is a partnership between Wideopen
Local History Society, North Tyneside Council, Seaton Burn Community High
School, Bellway and the Tyne & Wear Heritage Forum.

At Wideopen, the HeritageACT! project is about linking the village to its former
industrial past through the pathway (the former waggonway) which directly links
the community to the former colliery site, now Weetslade Country Park run by the
Northumberland Wildlife Trust.

The work undertaken for phase one of this project has included research into the
history of the colliery and then the design of four interpretation boards which
have then been produced and positioned through the help of Bellway Homes. The
involvement of students from Seaton Burn Community College in the project has
been particularly welcome. Students have produced a bench as part of their
Design and Technology lessons and they are currently working on the conservation
and restoration of two mining tubs which were used underground, some two hundred
years ago. The tubs when restored will be positioned at the entrance to the
waggonway.

Following the completion of phase one work is now to begin on the second phase.
This will involve extending the current work to the final stage of the
waggonway, joining the path to Weetslade Country Park with the setting up of
further interpretation boards and benches and including the conservation of the
original waggonway bridge, dating from the mid-nineteenth century.

As with other HeritageACT! schemes this project provides a community with a
reminder of its past history, a way to emphasise local identity through the
conservation of remaining heritage features from a vanished industrial past.
