    <h1>The Tyne & Wear Heritage Forum</h1>

    <p>The Tyne & Wear Heritage Forum was formed in 2015 by
    representatives of local heritage groups active within the North-East of
    England. These groups celebrate the period of industrialization associated with
    Tyne & Wear, County Durham and Northumberland, when the region was at the
    forefront of world development during the period of the industrial
    revolution.</p>
    
    <p>The TWHF is an alliance of key heritage bodies and individuals active
    within the North-East of England. At a time of restricted public funding for 
    protection and preservation of heritage, the Forum seeks to make a tangible
    and significant impact on the regional environment to the benefit of those
    who live and work here.</p>
