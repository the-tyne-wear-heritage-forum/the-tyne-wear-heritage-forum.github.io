Welcome to our new website! It's been streamlined to make sure that it's as easy as possible to find important information about the Forum,
our projects, and any upcoming events. Plus, this new site is mobile friendly---meaning that you can easily check it on your phone or tablet. Let's have a look at
what's on the new website!

You can find some information about our work, as well as some of our previous case studies on [the _Heritage Act!_ page](/heritageAct). If you
would like to get involved with the _HeritageAct!_ project, don't hesitate to drop us an email at [tynewearheritageforum@gmail.com](mailto:tynewearheritageforum@gmail.com).

The [_Events_ page](/events) shows an updating list of our events, past and present. Be sure to check back regularly to check for new events being organised!
If that sounds too much like hard work, you could just [join our mailing list](/newsletter), or follow us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/TWHeritageForum)
and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TWHeritageForum). That way, you'll be among the first to know as soon as tickets go live for upcoming events!

Finally, you'll be able to find interesting posts written by members and friends of the TWHF on the [_Blog_ page](/blog). Be sure to check in regularly to check for new posts!
